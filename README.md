# Ditect-Labs-Physics-Informed-Deep-Learning

Week 1- Studying the concepts of Physics Informed Deep Learning and Symbolic Regression.

Week 2- Arranging the NGSIM dataset which was used for the research and pre-processing the dataset.

Week 3- Implementing the vanila Symbolic Regression model on our dataset at dt=1 and fine tuning it to get performance metrics (MSE). 

Week 4- Studying the concept of Deep Symbolic Optimization and how to implement it on TensorFlow.

Week 5,6- Starting the implementation of DSO using Tensorflow. Since DSO on Tensorflow is writen for Tensorflow version 1, it could not be implemented due to hardware issues.

Week 7,8- Understanding the alternative approach for this  and Implmenting DSO using Pytorch

Week 9,10- Fine tune the DSO using Pytorch method for our dataset to get better performance metric (MSE) and equations that can best define the relationship between our parameters.

Week 11,12- Implemeting ML based SyPy method on our dataset to get even better results and equations when compared with our previous two models with an Impressive RMSE of 0.5

Week 13- Fine tuning the PySr model by changing the operators in our function set to make it work on a wider range of equations
